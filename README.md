# Project-Hangman
#This project was made using Javascript/HTML/CSS. The project is based on the popular game: Hangman. FIrst, a word is introduced in the text box and after it is submitted, a number of "n" underscores and another text box will appear ("n" represents the length of the word). In the second text box you will be required to enter a letter which you think it can be in the word. After submitting the letter, the program will either replace the underscore with the input letter if it's existing in the word, or else will put it in the "tried letters" array. If you guess the word without running out of tries, you win, and a "Play again" button will appear that will let you play the game more times. If you use all your guesses, the program will show a "lose" message and it will automatically restart.
